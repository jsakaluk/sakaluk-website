abstract: 'There are many factors that may influence parenting, from societal norms
  and expectations, dispositional differences, experience and maturity, and availability
  of resources. In the current research, we examined how stable demographic characteristics
  associated with these different factors predict the goals parents pursue with their
  children. We examined whether the pursuit of four parenting goals—child love and
  security, child development, parent image, and child acceptance—varies based on
  the characteristics of parents (i.e., gender, age, and socioeconomic status) and
  their children (i.e., gender and age). First, we provided evidence for the measurement
  invariance of the Parenting Goals Scale. The results suggested that across key characteristics,
  parents largely pursue the same four parenting goals on which they could be meaningfully
  compared. Second, meta-analytic results ( k = 5; N total = 2,240) indicated that
  parents were largely similar in the goals they pursued with their children across
  their own and their child’s characteristics. We identified only a few exceptions,
  with these differences being small in magnitude: mothers and noncollege-educated
  parents pursued child love and security goals more than fathers and college-educated
  parents, older parents pursued child development goals less than younger parents,
  parents of older children pursued image goals more than parents of younger children,
  and lower income parents pursued child acceptance goals more than higher income
  parents. These results suggest that while there may be some small differences in
  parenting goal pursuit based on demographic characteristics, parents are largely
  motivated by similar goals when caring for their children.'
