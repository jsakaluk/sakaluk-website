abstract: Attachment styles are often primed by having participants recall and describe
  a relationship that is prototypical of a given attachment style. Researchers may
  exclude participants who cannot recall such a relationship or who describe relationships
  that do not conform to the assigned prime. I suggest that excluding participants
  is untenable and may threaten a studyâ€™s validity. In the present research, I examine
  predictors of exclusion from an attachment-priming study. Priming insecure attachment
  resulted in greater odds of exclusion relative to a control condition. Female participants
  with greater sexual experience also had lesser odds of exclusion. These results
  suggest that attachmentpriming procedures contribute to participant exclusion that
  compromise internal and external validity. Discussion focuses on directions for
  future attachment-priming research.
