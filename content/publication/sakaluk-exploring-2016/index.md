abstract: 'While outlining his vision of The New Statistics, Cumming (2014) proposes
  that a more rigorous and cumulative psychological science will be built, in part,
  by having psychologists abandon traditional null-hypothesis signiﬁcance testing
  (NHST) approaches, and conducting small-scale meta-analyses on their data whenever
  possible. In the present paper, I propose an alternative system for conducting rigorous
  and replicable psychological investigations, which I describe as Exploring Small,
  Conﬁrming Big. I begin with a critical evaluation of the merits of NHST and small-scale
  meta-analyses, and argue that NHST does have a valuable role in the scientiﬁc process,
  whereas small-scale meta-analyses will do little to advance a cumulative science.
  I then present an overview of an alternative system for producing cumulative and
  replicable psychological research: Exploring Small, Conﬁrming Big. It involves a
  two-step process to psychological research, consisting of (1) small N investigation(s),
  in which psychologists use NHST to develop exploratory models; and (2) strong, conﬁrmatory
  tests of exploratory models, by analyzing new and/or existing large N datasets with
  variables that capture the effect(s) of interest from the Exploring Small stage.
  I conclude by discussing several anticipated beneﬁts and challenges of adopting
  the Exploring Small, Conﬁrming Big approach.'
