abstract: 'Objective: Typical executive functioning (EF) measurements do not reﬂect
  the complexity of daily life. We derived an executive behavior screener from the
  BASC-2-PRS-A using a previously derived four-component model of EF and provided
  support for the use of the screener in adolescent populations. Methods: A total
  of 2,722 census-matched American adolescents were sampled. We assigned 25 items
  a priori to four executive factors (problem solving, attentional control, behavioral
  control, and emotional control) and evaluated via conﬁrmatory factor analysis, invariance
  testing and differential item functioning (DIF) models. Results: We found acceptable-to-good
  reliability and that the four-factor model had the best ﬁt. We showed DIF for age
  and socioeconomic status (SES). While groups were invariant based on sex, latent
  mean comparisons showed signiﬁcant differences. Conclusions: Construct validity
  of the adolescent four-factor model as measured through the screener was supported.
  Females demonstrated fewer executive behavior problems. Standardized norms are available
  and split by age and sex. SES may inﬂuence the interpretation of T-scores. Continued
  exploration and development of the screener is suggested.'
