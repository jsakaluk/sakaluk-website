 abstract = {Objective: Typical executive functioning (EF) measurements do not reﬂect the complexity of daily life. We derived an executive behavior screener from the BASC-2-PRS-A using a previously derived four-component model of EF and provided support for the use of the screener in adolescent populations.
Methods: A total of 2,722 census-matched American adolescents were sampled. We assigned 25 items a priori to four executive factors (problem solving, attentional control, behavioral control, and emotional control) and evaluated via conﬁrmatory factor analysis, invariance testing and differential item functioning (DIF) models.
Results: We found acceptable-to-good reliability and that the four-factor model had the best ﬁt. We showed DIF for age and socioeconomic status (SES). While groups were invariant based on sex, latent mean comparisons showed signiﬁcant differences.
Conclusions: Construct validity of the adolescent four-factor model as measured through the screener was supported. Females demonstrated fewer executive behavior problems. Standardized norms are available and split by age and sex. SES may inﬂuence the interpretation of T-scores. Continued exploration and development of the screener is suggested.},
