 abstract = {In seven studies (ncross-sectional ¼ 1,699, nlongitudinal ¼ 118), we developed a measure of relationship norm strength defined as qualities that make the rules and expectations in romantic couples more or less likely to be followed. In our six cross-sectional samples, the resulting Relationship Norm Strength Questionnaire (RNSQ) yielded consistent norm tractability, norm agreement, anticipated punishment for deviance, and norm explicitness factors, and estimated factors generally demonstrated evidence of convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity. Meta-analyzed effects across these samples—yielding more reliable and generalizable estimates—indicated that greater norm tractability and norm agreement were strongly linked to higher levels of relationship quality. Further supporting our model of relationship norm functioning, results from our 8-week longitudinal study of community members in relationships indicated that greater levels of norm tractability and agreement resulted in greater subsequent norm conformity. Taken together, our results suggest that relationship norm strength offers a promising new perspective on relational well-being and can add to a more comprehensive account of normative processes in close relationships.},
