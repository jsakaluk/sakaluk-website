abstract: In seven studies (ncross-sectional ¼ 1,699, nlongitudinal ¼ 118), we developed
  a measure of relationship norm strength defined as qualities that make the rules
  and expectations in romantic couples more or less likely to be followed. In our
  six cross-sectional samples, the resulting Relationship Norm Strength Questionnaire
  (RNSQ) yielded consistent norm tractability, norm agreement, anticipated punishment
  for deviance, and norm explicitness factors, and estimated factors generally demonstrated
  evidence of convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity. Meta-analyzed effects
  across these samples—yielding more reliable and generalizable estimates—indicated
  that greater norm tractability and norm agreement were strongly linked to higher
  levels of relationship quality. Further supporting our model of relationship norm
  functioning, results from our 8-week longitudinal study of community members in
  relationships indicated that greater levels of norm tractability and agreement resulted
  in greater subsequent norm conformity. Taken together, our results suggest that
  relationship norm strength offers a promising new perspective on relational well-being
  and can add to a more comprehensive account of normative processes in close relationships.
