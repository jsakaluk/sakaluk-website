abstract: 'Comparative research involving consensually non-monogamous (CNM) relationships
  and outcomes related to well-being continues to grow as an area of interest within
  sexual science. However, claims of sameness and/or difference between groups rely
  on two critical, yet widely under-appreciated assumptions: that the concepts being
  compared between groups are the same (i.e., measurement invariance), and that logically
  and statistically coherent procedures are used for evaluating sameness (i.e., equivalence
  testing). We evaluated the state of measurement invariance and equivalence across
  three studies, involving different types of CNM comparisons (i.e., relationship
  types, partner types) and designs (analysis of primary individual data, primary
  dyadic data, and secondary data). Our invariance tests of CNM compared to monogamous
  individuals (Study 1) and “primary” compared to “secondary” partners in dyadic appraisal
  of CNM individuals (Study 2) revealed that many measures of well-being failed to
  replicate their measurement models and were not generalizable across relationship
  types or partner types. Our reanalyses of existing comparative CNM effects using
  individual and meta-analyzed equivalence tests (Study 3), meanwhile, indicated that
  this literature requires more consistent reporting practices and larger samples,
  as most studies produced uninformative tests of equivalence. Our results illustrate
  the importance of auxiliary hypothesis evaluation and statistical procedure selection
  for generating informative comparative tests. Our findings also highlight potential
  divergences in social construction of well-being. We offer suggestions for researchers,
  reviewers, and editors in terms of needed methodological reforms for future comparative
  CNM research.'
