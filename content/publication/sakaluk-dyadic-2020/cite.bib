 abstract = {Comparisons of group means, variances, correlations, and/or regression slopes involving psychological variables rely on an assumption of measurement invarianceâ€“that the latent variables under investigation have equivalent meaning and measurement across group. When measures are noninvariant, replicability suffers, as comparisons are either conceptually meaningless, or hindered by inflated Type I error rates. We propose that the failure to account for interdependence amongst dyad members when testing measurement invariance may be a potential source of unreplicable findings in relationship research. We develop fully dyadic versions of invariance-testing in an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model framework, and propose a Registered Report for gauging the extent of dyadic (non)invariance in romantic relationship research.},
