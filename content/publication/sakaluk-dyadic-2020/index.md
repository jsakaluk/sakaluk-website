abstract: Comparisons of group means, variances, correlations, and/or regression slopes
  involving psychological variables rely on an assumption of measurement invarianceâ€“that
  the latent variables under investigation have equivalent meaning and measurement
  across group. When measures are noninvariant, replicability suffers, as comparisons
  are either conceptually meaningless, or hindered by inflated Type I error rates.
  We propose that the failure to account for interdependence amongst dyad members
  when testing measurement invariance may be a potential source of unreplicable findings
  in relationship research. We develop fully dyadic versions of invariance-testing
  in an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model framework, and propose a Registered Report
  for gauging the extent of dyadic (non)invariance in romantic relationship research.
