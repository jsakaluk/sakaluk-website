abstract: 'In this article, we propose analytic review (AR) as a solution to the problem
  of misreporting statistical results in psychological science. AR requires authors
  submitting manuscripts for publication to also submit the data file and syntax used
  during analyses. Regular reviewers or statistical experts then review reported analyses
  in order to verify that the analyses reported were actually conducted and that the
  statistical values are accurately reported. We begin by describing the problem of
  misreporting in psychology and introduce the basic AR process. We then highlight
  both primary and secondary benefits of adopting AR and describe different permutations
  of the AR system, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. We conclude
  by attempting to dispel three anticipated concerns about AR: that it will increase
  the workload placed on scholars, that it will infringe on the traditional peer-review
  process, and that it will hurt the image of the discipline of psychology. Although
  implementing AR will add one more step to the bureaucratic publication process,
  we believe it can be implemented in an efficient manner that would greatly assist
  in decreasing the frequency and impact of misreporting while also providing secondary
  benefits in other domains of scientific integrity.'
