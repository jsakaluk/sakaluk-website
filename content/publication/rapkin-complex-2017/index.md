abstract: 'The condition dependence of male sexual traits plays a central role in
  sexual selection theory. Relatively little, however, is known about the condition
  dependence of chemical signals used in mate choice and their subsequent effects
  on male mating success. Furthermore, few studies have isolated the speciÔ¨Åc nutrients
  responsible for condition-dependent variation in male sexual traits. Here, we used
  nutritional geometry to determine the effect of protein (P) and carbohydrate (C)
  intake on male cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) expression and mating success in male
  decorated crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus). We show that both traits are maximized
  at a moderate-to-high intake of nutrients in a P:C ratio of 1 : 1.5. We also show
  that female precopulatory mate choice exerts a complex pattern of linear and quadratic
  sexual selection on this condition-dependent variation in male CHC expression. Structural
  equation modelling revealed that although the effect of nutrient intake on mating
  success is mediated through condition-dependent CHC expression, it is not exclusively
  so, suggesting that other traits must also play an important role. Collectively,
  our results suggest that the complex interplay between nutrient intake, CHC expression
  and mating success plays an important role in the operation of sexual selection
  in G. sigillatus.'
