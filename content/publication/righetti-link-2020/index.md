abstract: This meta-analysis reveals that although being motivated to sacrifice for
  the relationship was linked to beneficial outcomes for the individual, the partner,
  and the relationship, there was a negative association between actually performing
  sacrifices and peopleâ€™s own well-being. The appraisals of sacrifice as positive
  or costly were also reliability associated with well-being.
