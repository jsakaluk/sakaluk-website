 abstract = {This meta-analysis reveals that although being motivated to sacrifice for the relationship was linked to beneficial outcomes for the individual, the partner, and the relationship, there was a negative association between actually performing sacrifices and peopleâ€™s own well-being. The appraisals of sacrifice as positive or costly were also reliability associated with well-being.},
