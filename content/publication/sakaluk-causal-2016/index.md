abstract: Research on attachment and condom use has been limited to correlational
  studies of self-report measures, yielding inconsistent results. Here, we examined
  the causal effects of attachment priming on self-reported condom use attitudes and
  an observational measure of condom acquisition behavior. In three experiments, participants
  were exposed to one of three attachment primes (security, anxiety, or avoidance)
  or a control prime. For Study 1, participants in the security and anxiety conditions
  preferred condom non-use to a greater extent, compared to participants in the avoidance
  condition. This effect was replicated in Study 2, and was mediated by perceptions
  of sexual health threat. In Study 3, the effect of security priming on condom acquisition
  behavior was eliminated through the use of a framing manipulation, though the effect
  of primed attachment on condom use attitudes was not signiﬁcant. A meta-analysis,
  however, revealed that the predicted effects of attachment priming were consistent
  across the three studies, supporting the role of attachment in evaluations of condom
  use. Priming attachment security or anxiety leads participants to perceive their
  sexual partners as less of a sexual health threat, resulting in a devaluation of
  condom use. Primed security also reduced condom acquisition behavior, though this
  negative effect eliminated by framing condomsasprotectingapartner’ssexual health.Overall,thesestudies
  suggest that relational factors, such as attachment, require greater consideration
  when studying sexual health and designing interventions.
