abstract: 'Sexual health reﬂects physical, emotional, mental, and social elements
  of sexual well-being. Researchers often position self-esteem (i.e., global or domain-speciﬁc
  evaluations of self) as a key correlate of sexual health. We present the ﬁrst comprehensive
  meta-analysis of correlations between self-esteem and sexual health. Our synthesis
  includes 305 samples from 255 articles, containing 870 correlations from 191,161
  unique participants. The overall correlation between self-esteem and sexual health
  was positive and small (r = .12, 95% CI: .09, .15), characterised by considerable
  heterogeneity and robust to diﬀerent corrections. Sexual functioning (r = .27, 95%
  CI: .21, .34) was more strongly associated with self-esteem than were safe sex (r
  = .10, 95% CI: .07, .13) and sexual consent (r = .19, 95% CI: .13, .24), and sexual
  permissiveness was unassociated with self-esteem (r = −.02, 95% CI: -.05, .008).
  Most moderators were nonsigniﬁcant, although moderator data were inconsistently
  available, and samples were North American-centric. Evidence of publication bias
  was inconsistent, and study quality, theory usage, and background research were
  not reliably associated with study outcomes. Our synthesis suggests a need for more
  speciﬁc theories of self-esteem corresponding to unique domains of sexual, highlighting
  a need for future theorising and research.'
