abstract: In this article, we present results from a‘‘cohort-longitudinal’’analysis
  of sexual attitudes and behaviors based on a large sample of young adults (N = 7,777)
  obtained from a university setting over a 23-year period. We investigated gender,
  ethnicity, and cohort differences in sexual permissiveness, endorsement of the double
  standard, and sociosexuality. Compared to women, men had more permissive attitudes,
  particularly about sex in casual relationships, endorsed the double standard to
  a greater degree, and had a more unrestricted sociosexuality. Black men were generally
  more permissive than White, Hispanic, and Asian men, whereas ethnic differences
  were not found among women. Participants from the 1995–1999 cohort were slightly
  less permissive than those from the 1990–1994 and 2005–2012 cohorts. Although prior
  meta-analytic studies (e.g., Petersen & Hyde, 2010) found reduced genderdifferences
  in sexuality over time, our cohort analyses suggest that gender differences in sexual
  permissiveness have not changed over the past two decades among college students.
