abstract: "Lilienfeld (2007, Psychological treatments that cause harm. Perspectives\
  \ on Psychological Science, 2, 53) identified a list of potentially harmful therapies\
  \ (PHTs). Given concerns regarding the replicability of scientific findings, we\
  \ conducted a meta-scientific review of Lilienfeld's PHTs to determine the evidential\
  \ strength for harm. We evaluated the extent to which effects used as evidence of\
  \ harm were as follows: (a) (in)correctly reported; (b) well-powered; (c) statistically\
  \ significant at an inflated rate given their power; and (d) stronger compared with\
  \ null effects of ineffectiveness or evidence of benefit, based on a Bayesian index\
  \ of evidence. We found evidence of harm from some PHTs, though most metrics were\
  \ ambiguous. To enhance provision of ethical and science-based care, a comprehensive\
  \ reexamination of what constitutes evidence for claims of harm is necessary."
