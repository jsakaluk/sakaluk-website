abstract: This study highlights how certain therapist practices relate to the experiences
  of clients who are in consensually nonmonogamous (CNM) relationships. The results
  identify practices that are perceived as generally helpful or unhelpful, and point
  to the need for additional research, training, and guidelines to bridge therapistsâ€™
  knowledge gap regarding CNM.
