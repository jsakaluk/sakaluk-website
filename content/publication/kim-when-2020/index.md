abstract: In most long-term romantic relationships, partners experience sexual conflicts
  of interest in which one partner declines the other partner’s sexual advances. We
  investigated the distinct ways people reject a partner’s advances (i.e., with reassuring,
  hostile, assertive, and deflecting behaviors) in Studies 1 and 2. Using cross-sectional
  (Study 3) and daily experience methods (Study 4), we investigated how perceptions
  of a partner’s rejection behaviors are linked with the rejected partner’s relationship
  and sexual satisfaction. We found robust evidence that perceived partner reassuring
  behaviors were associated with greater satisfaction, whereas perceived partner hostile
  behaviors were associated with lower levels of satisfaction. Perceived partner responsiveness
  was a key mechanism underlying the effects. Findings for assertive and deflecting
  behaviors were limited, but the effect of deflecting behaviors was qualified by
  levels of hostile behaviors for sexual satisfaction. Findings provide the first
  empirical investigation of the specific ways partners can decline one another’s
  advances to preserve satisfaction.
