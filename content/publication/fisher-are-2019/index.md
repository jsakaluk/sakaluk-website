abstract: Past research consistently suggests that single people (i.e. singles) are
  stigmatized, but do they constitute a stigmatized 'group'? The current research
  will provide deeper insight into the stigmatization and well-being of singles by
  understanding the ‘group-y’ nature of singles, and how identification with groups
  and perceptions of groups map onto discrimination and prejudice. Study 1 will examine
  the extent to which singles identify as part of a group. Participants will be assigned
  a novel minimal group identity and then complete measures of group identification
  for four distinct group memberships (e.g., minimal group, relationship status, sexual
  orientation, nationality). We hypothesize that single participants' identification
  with their single group will be lower compared to other identities—including partnered
  people—although a smaller subset of singles may identify strongly with other singles.
  We also hypothesize that singles in general will perceive less discrimination towards
  singles relative to other aspects of their identity. In contrast, Study 2 will examine
  the extent to which singles are perceived as a group and the extent to which they
  are perceived as being responsible for their group membership. Participants will
  complete measures of entitativity and perceptions of responsibility for similar
  outgroup identities as in Study 1 (e.g., single people or people in romantic relationships,
  sexual or asexual people, etc.). We hypothesize that singles will be rated lower
  in entitativity than people in romantic relationships and other groups, yet rated
  higher in responsibility than other groups. Moreover, we hypothesize that prejudice
  towards singles will be more acceptable than prejudice towards other groups. Throughout
  both studies, we will use Bayesian sequential analyses in order to efficiently acquire
  evidence in favor or against our experimental hypotheses. We discuss the importance
  of group-based theoretical perspectives for understanding the current and future
  stigmatization and well-being of singles.
