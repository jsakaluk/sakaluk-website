abstract: Sexual script research (Simon & Gagnon 1969, 1986) bourgeoned following
  Simon and Gagnon's groundbreaking work. Empirical measurement of sexual script adherence
  has been limited, however, as no measures exist that have undergone rigorous development
  and validation. We conducted three studies to examine current dominant sexual scripts
  of heterosexual adults and to develop a measure of endorsement of these scripts.
  In Study 1, we conducted three focus groups of men (n = 19) and four of women (n = 20)
  to discuss the current scripts governing sexual behavior. Results supported scripts
  for sex drive, physical and emotional sex, sexual performance, initiation and gatekeeping,
  and evaluation of sexual others. In Study 2, we used these qualitative findings
  to develop a measure of script endorsement, the Sexual Script Scale. Factor analysis
  of data from 721 participants revealed six interrelated factors demonstrating initial
  construct validity. In Study 3, confirmatory factor analysis of a separate sample
  of 289 participants supported the model from Study 2, and evidence of factorial
  invariance and test-retest reliability was obtained. This article presents the results
  of these studies, documenting the process of scale development from formative research
  through to confirmatory testing, and suggests future directions for the continued
  development of sexual scripting theory.
