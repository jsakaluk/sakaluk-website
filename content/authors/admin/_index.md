The MaRSS Lab is a member of the Western Interpersonal Relationships Ensemble (WIRE). Our lab conducts research on romantic relationships and sexuality, with an emphasis on using inclusive and transparent research methods, and advanced statistical modeling approaches. Topics studied in our lab often include aspects individual, relational and sexual identity (e.g., casual sex relationships, consensual non-monogamy, queer sexualities, singlehood) and well-being (e.g., experiences of prejudice, relationship quality, sexual satisfaction). Throughout our work, we often employ forms of measurement modeling (e.g. factor analyses, invariance testing, taxometrics) and research synthesis methods (e.g., meta-analysis, methodological trends analysis), enjoy creating analytic tools (e.g., R Packages) and resources (e.g., tutorial papers).
